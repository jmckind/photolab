# photolab

A simple photo gallery application.

## Development

Setup the virtual environment and dependencies.

    $ cd <PROJECT_DIR>/photolab
    $ mkvirtualenv photolab
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the dependencies have been installed, start the development server and get to work.

    $ ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080

This will start the development server on the local machine, listening on port 8080.
