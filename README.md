# PhotoLab

A simple photo gallery application.

## Development

Check out the source code to a directory on your local machine. We will refer to this location as the `<PROJECT_DIR>`.

    $ git clone https://github.com/jmckind/photolab.git
    $ cd <PROJECT_DIR>

A `Makefile` has been provided in the `<PROJECT_DIR>` to setup the development environment.

    $ make setup

Next, run the development server and get to work!

    $ make run

This will start the development server on the local machine, listening on port 8080. You should be able to access the application at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080).
